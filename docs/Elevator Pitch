Hi! I’m Coulson Loptmann. My background includes food service and data entry,
but I’m looking for a career change towards coding. My mother-in-law referred me
to SavvyCoders and knew it was exactly what I was looking for; a well-respected
course with a graduation certificate that actually meant something.

As someone with a love for brightening someone’s day with something fun, I
decided to make my Capstone project a video game. It’s a 2D platformer game,
which is like the old Super Mario Bros. with left to right movement and a focus
on reaching a goal.

This game, White Mountain, is a fantasy story following Ballungr, a Dwarf, searching for his missing love. He must navigate multiple environments, assist other characters in their quests, and put together the tale of how to rescue his beloved.
